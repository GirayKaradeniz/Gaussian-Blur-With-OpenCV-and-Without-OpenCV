# Gaussian-Blur-With-OpenCV-and-Without-OpenCV
This project demonstrates the creation and application of a Gaussian blur to an image using both a custom convolution function and OpenCV's built-in Gaussian blur function. It reads an image, generates a Gaussian kernel, applies the blur, and displays the original and blurred images for comparison.
